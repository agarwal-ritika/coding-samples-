# coding-samples-
These are coding samples in R. They display the use of multiple large datasets to conduct data cleaning, data analysis and data presentation. 
The short descriptions for each code sample are given below:

Education_PISA: The code has 2 parts. One uses the data from the French primary schools survey, and analyses progress of pupils between 1st and 3rd standard. Then it produces transition matrices between tests 1 and 2 and tests 2 and 3. The code then compares children born in Jan to children born in Dec and the evolution of their progress in France, further looking at differences arising between children of executives and blue collar workers as well. The next part of the code analyses data from PISA for France, Norway and Vietnam. It looks at the number of missing values, runs the PISA function to determine the country-level average scores in math, reading and science. The code then looks at differences amongst girls and boys and whether these differences are similar between countries. The code produces very informative and clear graphs to compare girls and boys, across countries with confidence intervals to see if the differences are statistically significant.

Inequality_Cote d'Ivoire: This code looks at many interesting phenomenon in Cote d'Ivoire. First the code inspects outliers. Second, to see how price indexes changed in the region to understand inflation, the code calculates the Laspeyres, Paasches and Fisher Indexes. Then, using CPI and PPP calculations, the code attempts to compare poverty rates in Cote d'Ivoire between regions and overtime. Finally, the code has some very interesting graphs. First, the code plots a Growth Incidence Curve, which helps make predictions of whether inequality increased. Second, the code plots Lorenz Curves to understand inequality in Cote d'Ivoire.

Unemployment_French LFS: The code looks at unemployment in France using the French Labour Force Survey data. Using the ILO and INSEE definitions, the code calculates the official employment and unemployment rates. The code then looks at the evolution of structure of working-age population that is employed, unemployed and inactive between different quarters using CrossTables. Finally, the code looks at differences in unemployment rate on the basis of gender, age and highest qualification.

Poverty_EU SILC: The objective of this code is to calculate poverty in UK, Denmark and Spain using the EU SILC dataset. The poverty rates are calculated according to both the US definition (absolute) and EU definition (relative). The code also produces some CrossTables to decompose what poverty can mean in terms of ability to meet expenses or other such variables.

Child Mortality_Cote d'Ivoire: This project uses Child Mortality data from Cote d'Ivoire. The main objective of the code is to calculate mortality rates, stunting rates, correlations of stunting with poverty.
